                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2025</h2>
               <p>Good day prospective caregiver trainee. <br>

This is to give a general overview of the caregiver profession,training requirement with our academy amidst other information.

The caregiver/health care assistant is a highly sort after career path especially in diaspora.

Because of the massive investment in the health care sector and the care of the elderly,caregivers are heavily needed by senior citizens abroad.
</p>

                <br>
               <p>Because caregivers are in high demand abroad,it is usually very rare to have their visa turned down as they are valuable part of the health care team abroad .

In Europe,America ,Australia etc,an average caregiver receives at least 4.5-7m naira every month as salary.

Alot of Nigerian who you see building massions in Nigeria are caregivers or health care assistant abroad.

At Chijerx Caregiver Academy,we give you both the theoretical ands practical training to be an effective caregiver as we have Doctors,Nurses and  professional caregivers who were trained by America Caregiver Association and in the United Arab Emirates as part of our training team.
</p>

                <br>

               <p>
We have training venues in Abuja,Benin city,Cross River State and still counting.

In as much as we advice and encourage physical training,we also offer online training for those who can't make it to a physical training venue or it is quite far away....Simply chat us up on 07045188696

Currently, physical training fee is #100,000 while online training is #60,000 payable to the training company account

Chijerx Caregiver Academy
Providus bank
9999299095.

send receipt after payment to 07045188696 and your full name correctly arranged to the same number or your branch lecturer.


After the training,you are expected to write an exam which you must pass.

Failing the exam would require you to pay half the training fee ((#50,000) for physical and #30,000 for online) to be able to join the next batch to write the exam. 

It is usually not so difficult to pass the exam if you read the materials given to you and you attend classes.

</p>

<p>After you pass the exam,if you have a travel agency that can help you with job placement ,visa processing,you can go ahead but if you desire we recommend a travel agency with good success report ,we can connect you to a travel agency we know with good success report.


Once again, congratulations as you explore this career path that will never go into extinction giving both non medics and medics opportunity to emigrate with much more ease.
